# Tetris-AI-
This is a project is an attempt of implementing Genetic Algorithm onto Tetris. The goal is to create an AI that is able to  recognize pattern.
# Structure of the code
This project is constructed using pytorch and pygame and it consist of two part. The first part is the training platform. It is used to optimize the value in the neuronetwork. It is tuned using genetic algorithm. The second part is the performing platform. The platform is build to visualize the gameplay of the AI. It also consist a human playable part which allows comparision of performance which is trackd using a score system.
# Training platform
The training platfrom is split into an total of
